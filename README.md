# Smart Greenhouse Controller

**Smart Greenhouse Controller** is an IoT-based solution for managing greenhouse environments with real-time temperature and humidity monitoring and automatic control mechanisms. This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor, and web server functionality to provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling greenhouse conditions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays temperature and humidity data on a dynamic web interface with live updates.
- **Automatic Control**:
  - Fan control for temperature regulation based on customizable thresholds with hysteresis to prevent rapid switching.
  - Humidifier control for maintaining optimal humidity levels.
- **Web-Based Interface**:
  - Accessible through any browser on the local network.
  - Responsive design with easy-to-read data and real-time status updates of the fan and humidifier.
- **Built-in Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Connects to a local Wi-Fi network for seamless operation and monitoring.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Set temperature and humidity thresholds directly in the code for customization.

## Technologies Used

- ESP32 microcontroller
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Arduino IDE for development
- HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome for the web interface
